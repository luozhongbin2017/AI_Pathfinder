# Artificial Intelligence Pathfinder

### Goal: <br>
Develop a Q-Learning AI algorithm that can find the shortest distance between any two areas in this environment: <br>

### Description: <br>
This project uses reinforcement learning tehcniques to calculate the best path between a start and end point in a virtual "warehouse". <br>
This process could be used to automate bots in a warehouse to carry items between two points, thus cutting costs by optimizing the logistical processes. <br>
